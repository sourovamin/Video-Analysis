# Video-Analysis
Matlab script to analyze video by obtaining important properties of the frames and the audio signal.

*Run "video_analysis.m" file and in command window: "video_analysis('Video File Path')"

Features:
*Detach audio from the video
*Extract a number of frames and save them in the newly created folder with video file name
*Obtain all important properties for each frames. These properties are:
 RGB color percentages
 Number of objects
 Area of objects
 Number of edges
 Euler Number
 Gradient magnitude
 Gradient direction
 Mean squared error
 Signal to noise ratio
 Peak SNR
 Correlation coefficient
 Mean of matrix
 Standard deviation
 Entropy
 Image pixel weight
 Image threshold
*Calculate the values for the detached audio signal:
 Maximum signal value
 Minimum signal value
 Mean signal value
 RMS value
 Dynamic range
 Crest factor
 Auto correlation
*Save all these data in CSV files.
*Representation with fugures and graphs.
